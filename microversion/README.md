# How to download this

* Go to https://github.com/megahomyak/autopainter/releases/latest and grab a zip from there
* Drag the folder inside of it onto your desktop
* Open the folder on the desktop

# How to set this up

* If you mess up during the setup, just close its window and try again
* Run "setup.bat" (by double-clicking on it)
* Wait for all dependencies to install (you will see "Ready" in the window when it's over)
* Switch to Roblox
* Make sure your canvas is open and your mouse cursor is not on the canvas
* Press the "r" key on your keyboard. Wait for about three seconds afterwards
* Click on the color picker button
* Click on the field for text inputs. Make sure you got it right: a blinking cursor should appear
* Click on the checkmark button (the one for confirmation)
* You're done! If button positions change in the future, run this script again

# How to use

* Drop any image into the folder with the scripts
* Run "run.bat"
* Switch to Roblox. The program will begin drawing as soon as it sees an empty canvas of the same size as in the setup. Don't forget to move your mouse out of the canvas!
